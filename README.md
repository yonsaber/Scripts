Scripting
===

This is a project to keep track of all the utility scripts I write, from simple install scripts for OSX (I am lazy) to what ever I end up coming up with (also makes sure I don't lose them).

Feel free to modify these scripts as you see fit and alter them to improve them, I am always willing to check pull requests. I am by no means a good shell or batch coder so improvements are welcome! 

DISCLAIMER

If one of these scripts breaks something well sorry. I have tested them on my system and they have worked.
